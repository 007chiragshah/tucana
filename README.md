## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

The Cloud team has implemented an on-premise Central Hub deployment strategy using automation tools like Ansible, Helm charts, and Rancher. This approach ensures a streamlined, scalable, and efficient installation and management process. The main goals of this setup are as follows:

- **Simplify Deployment Across Multiple Nodes**: Automating the installation process using Ansible eliminates manual errors and reduces setup time for diverse infrastructure environments.
- **Streamline Application Deployment**: Using Helm charts ensures consistent and repeatable deployment of Kubernetes resources, making application updates and scaling seamless.
- **Efficient Kubernetes Management**: Rancher provides centralized management of Kubernetes clusters, enabling easy monitoring, troubleshooting, and governance of the infrastructure.
- **Enhance Reliability and Scalability**: The integration of these tools improves operational efficiency and ensures that the system can scale to meet future demands.

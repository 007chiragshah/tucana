### Infrastructure Component Considerations

In this section we will provide a brief introduction of key components of the infrastructure.

1. **Docker**:
- Central Hub uses docker in our infra as a docker runtime and also we are transforming our code into a Docker image, and when we need to set up the Central Hub deployment, we simply download the latest image and 
  run a Docker container with it to deploy the entire infrastructure.
- We used docker as a runtime in our infrastructure because of it's ease of use, also it's provides a complete set of tools for container management, including Docker compose we can manage the multicontainer 
  applications within a single configuration file. Additionally, Docker has ability to create multistage Dockerfiles which helps us to build light weight Docker images by seperating the build environment from 
  the runtime environment. This reduce the image size and improves the performance.


2. **Rancher**:
- Central Hub uses Rancher in our infra for creating and managing the kubernetes cluster of one master node, three worker nodes, and one load balancer.
- We used Rancher in our infra for kubernetes cluster because of it's user friendly interface, ability to handle multi-cluster environment, ease of use and simplified application deployement making it ideal 
  choice for our infrastructure.


3. **Kubernetes Cluster**:
- Central Hub uses kubernetes cluster of one controlplane node, three worker nodes, and one load balancer node, for deploying and managing our different centralhub application with high reliability and availability    with seamless deployment and management of the application.
- We used kubernetes as a orchastration tool as it's provides features like multi-node support, High availability, advance orchastration features like canary deployment and rolling updates etc, resource 
  efficiency, ease to scale the application etc.


4. **Ansible**:
- Central Hub uses ansible for the automation and deploying our whole infrastructure on multiple nodes by deviding into five main task, which further broken down to smaller sub-task, where all the tasks are consist 
  of simple yaml files.
- We used ansible for automation in our infra as it is a powerful agentless automation tool means it doesn't required to installation on the target machines so it's reduce its complexity also it uses a simple 
  yaml file consist of different tasks. It simplifies automation with its modular structure where task, variable and value are in seperate files which provides easy management and reusability. It is defining 
  the desired states which makes sure of idempotency and reduce the errors.


5. **Helm Chart**
- Central Hub uses helm chart in our infra to deploying and managing the different central-hub applications.
- Advantage of using helm chart is it simplifies the kuberntes resource management by automating dependency handling and resource creating like with helmchart we do not have to create different resource like 
  service, deployment, pods, replicaset unlike kubernetes cluster as all these things automatically taken care by the helm chart by using the templates, charts and values.yaml files. It enables the easy 
  deployment, upgrades and rollback with version control.


6. **Istio**:
- Central Hub uses istio in our infra to encrypt the communication between service to service by enabling the mTLS (mutual TLS) protocol, where authentication required from both the end which makes communication 
  more secured.
- We used istio for this becaue it provides a great features like advanced traffice management, secured communication using mTLS protocol, supports both kubernetes and VM-based environment, more flexible for 
  large scale and multi node cluster.


7. **Monitoring**:
- In our infra Central Hub uses different monitoring tools for the different monitoring as mentioned below:
- **Kubernetes Dashboard**: Central Hub uses kubernetes dashboard for monitoring the kubernetes cluster, different resources state, resource performance monitoring, checking logs etc.
- **Loki Dashboard**: Central Hub uses loki dashboard to display the audit related logs and pod related logs.
- **Grafana Dashboard**: Central Hub uses Grafana dashboard to show color coded visulisation of the different alerts coming from the prometheus with the different views of the current alert. its status, also with 
  the table formate.

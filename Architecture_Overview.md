  ### **Control Plane Node**:

  - The control plane is responsible for container orchestration, making global decisions (e.g., scheduling), detecting/responding to cluster events, and maintains the state of a cluster.
  - The Kubernetes control plane consists of several components, each responsible for a specific task (as explained below). These components work together to ensure that each Kubernetes cluster‚Äôs state matches 
    the pre-defined desired state.

  #### 1. **Kube-API server**

  </div>

  - The kube-API server acts as the central communication hub for users, components, and the Kubernetes cluster. When using tools like kubectl, it communicates via HTTP REST APIs, while internal components such 
    as the scheduler and controllers use gRPC for interactions. The API server ensures secure communication through TLS, validating data for API objects, managing API requests, and authenticating and authorizing 
    users. It also coordinates processes between control plane and worker node components, ensuring smooth cluster operations.
  - Additionally, the API server exclusively interacts with etcd to store and retrieve cluster state information. It features a built-in bastion apiserver proxy, which enables external access to ClusterIP 
    services, providing a secure way to interact with the cluster's internal resources. This design allows the API server to serve as a robust and secure gateway for managing the Kubernetes ecosystem.


  2. **ETCD**:

  - etcd is a distributed key-value store designed to securely store Kubernetes cluster data, such as pod information, states, and namespaces. It is accessible only by the Kubernetes API server to ensure 
    security. Kubernetes interacts with etcd through its key-value API using gRPC, storing all objects in the /registry directory in key-value format.
  - The Kubernetes API server leverages etcd's watch feature to track changes to object states, enabling real-time updates and coordination. As the only StatefulSet component in the control plane, etcd serves as 
    a reliable and robust database for managing Kubernetes cluster data.

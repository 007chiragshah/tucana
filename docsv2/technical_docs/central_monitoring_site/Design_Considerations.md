<h2> ðŸ“ˆ Design Considerations </h2>
</div>

### Design Constraints

#### Hardware Limitations

- **Minimum Requirements**: The solution requires at least one 24 inches diagonal size display, running with a resolution of 1920x1080. It also requires a mouse and keyboard for interactibility, and run in a chrome/chromium browser.

#### Operating System Requirements

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: The code is written in Javascript/Typescript, which allows it to compile and run on all operating systems.

#### Performance Requirements

- **Network MTU**: The minimum MTU range for the network should be 1000 or higher.
- **Data Latency**: Given that this solution is for medical systems, data latency should not exceed 1 second.

#### Security Constraints

- **Compliance**: The implementation is compliant with the applicable requirements specified in IEC 62366-1:2020 standard
- **HIPAA Compliance**: The implementation must be HIPAA compliant.

### Data Management

- **HTTPS**: Non-realtime data such as patient information, beds data, and group management shall be only communicated through secure channels on a secure HTTPS connection with validated hosts.
- **WSS**: realtime data such as vitals and alerts shall only be communicated through secure channels on a secure WSS connection with a validated host.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

The Cloud team has implemented IEEE 11073 Service-oriented Device Connectivity(SDC) standarad is a communication protocol for medical devices and IT system in point-of-care environments.Main gole to use this as a communication protocol between Patient monitor and Central server as below. 

- Enable interoperability between medical devices from different OEM as well as Sibel sensor
- Allow devices to exchange patient health data with Central Monitoring system
- Improve the safety, security, and effectiveness of medical devices

<h2> ðŸ“Š Design Considerations </h2>

### Design Constraints

#### Hardware Limitations
- **Minimum Requirements**: The Web Gateway requires a minimum of 4 GiB of RAM. A stable network connection is essential for communicating with external APIs.

#### Operating System Requirements
- **Supported Platforms**: The code is written in Python, which allows it to compile and run on all operating systems.

#### Security Constraints
- **Authentication**: The Web Gateway must implement secure user authentication mechanisms, including token-based authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- **Data Encryption**: All sensitive data must be encrypted in transit using TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocols.
- **Compliance**: The solution should comply with relevant data privacy regulations, such HIPAA, where applicable.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

The Cloud team has adopted Health Level Seven (HL7) version 2.6 as the standard communication protocol for interfacing with hospital EHR systems and the Central Server. The HL7/Mirth gateway will facilitate interoperability, enabling seamless data exchange between the Central Server and healthcare providers' EHR systems. 

Key objectives are listed below include enhancing data safety and security, 
- supporting multiple transport protocols (TCP/IP, HTTP, MLLP)
- providing a user-friendly dashboard for message management.
- Mirth will also allow the creation of channels for defining data sources and transformations, ensuring effective integration across systems.
- Enable interoperability between EHR system from healthcare provider and the Sibel's Central Server.
- Allow Central Server to exchange patient health data with Healthcare provider's EHR system.

<h2> ðŸ“ˆ Design Considerations </h2>
</div>

### Design Constraints

#### Hardware Limitations
- **Minimum Requirements**: The solution requires a minimum of 256 Mib of RAM and 100m CPU as this microservice runs on the k8s container we can scale up or down based on the usage of the system currently Central Server infra is only running 1 instance of Audit Trail service.

#### Operating System Requirements
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: The code is written in python, which allows it to compile and run on all operating systems. For a cluster instance central server hosted container is running on Linux os 3.11.9-bookworm docker image. 

#### Performance Requirements
- **Data Latency**: Given that this microservice is for logging perpose data latency will not be a concerned here as all the messages are stored in queue untill it's get consumed.


#### Security Constraints
- **Authentication**: Only authorized user will be able to access the audit trail Apis to get the logs based on entity id.


### Data Management

- **PostgreSQL**: All the events are stored in PostgreSQL for audit purpose to provide forensic evidance of each important event.  
- **Kafka**: Stream patient data, vital information, physiological alerts, technical alerts, Authentication infromation, session details and all critical events to the following microservices.

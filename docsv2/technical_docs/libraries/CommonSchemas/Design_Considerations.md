<h2> ðŸ“Š Design Considerations </h2>
</div>

### Design Constraints

#### Hardware Limitations
- **Minimum Requirements**: The common schemas requires a minimum of 4 GiB of RAM. A stable network connection is essential for communicating with external APIs.

#### Operating System Requirements
- **Supported Platforms**: The code is written in Python, which allows it to compile and run on all operating systems.
